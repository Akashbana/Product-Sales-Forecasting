***Problem Statement***  

In the competitive retail industry, the ability to predict future sales accurately is crucial for operational and strategic planning. Product sales forecasting aims to estimate the number of products a store will sell in the future, based on various influencing factors such as store type, location, regional characteristics, promotional activities, and temporal variations (such as holidays and seasons). This project focuses on developing a predictive model that uses historical sales data from different stores to forecast sales for upcoming periods.

Aim is to predict future sales from stores to optimize following things:

1. Store inventory management   
2. Production planning    
3. Supply chain management

Data description:

Store_Type: Categorization of the store based on its type.
